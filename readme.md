# Welcome to Blend City

Here are a few of my project folders + .blend files. Files should be packed in for the most part but there are a few projects missing textures. Hope someone can learn from these! Feel free to use then in any way you'd like, I just ask that you let me know about it and link back to here if you do so :)

ps: All of these are only compatible / tested with Blender 2.8+
